This is my Car Booking app project based on React + Redux.

To run this app locally we have to RUN :
## git clone https://github.com/rahulsups/car-web-code.git

This app should be cloned into a car-web folder.

## cd car-web
into the folder.

Then we have to RUN:
## npm i

Finally, we RUN :

## npm start

To view the app, we have to open 

[http://localhost:3000/car-web/](http://localhost:3000/car-web/) in the browser.

The page will reload if we make edits.<br />
